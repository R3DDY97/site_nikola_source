Hi, I am Mrinal Purohit, and I am an undergraduate in Computer Science from Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore.

I dabble with Python on a regular basis writing scripts to solve trivial tasks. I have tried my hand at desktop application development, Windows 10/Windows Phone app development, however I am drawn to the Web. Presently, API's and web scraping fascinate me.

I am currently at [Geekskool](https://geekskool.com) trying to become a better programmer.

When I am not wasting time, I solve [Sudoku](http://websudoku.com/){:target="_blank"}, moderate the [Windows Phone](https://reddit.com/r/windowsphone){:target="_blank"} subreddit, solve a problem or two on [Codewars](http://codewars.com/users/iammrinal0){:target="_blank"}, and listen to [music](https://last.fm/user/iammrinal0){:target="_blank"}.

Want to collaborate on a project or get in touch with me? The best way is Twitter or mail.
