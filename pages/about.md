Hi, I am Mrinal Purohit and I go by `iammrinal0` on the interwebz. I am an undergraduate in Computer Science from Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore.

I used to dabble with Python, writing scripts, cli and web apps to solve trivial tasks. I have tried my hand at desktop application development, Windows 10/Windows Phone app development, however I am drawn to the Web. To check out my projects, head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/iammrinal0).

I was at GeekSkool for quite some time where I fiddled with Python, a bit of Haskell, and contributed to a language called [Clean](https://github.com/cleanlang/clean).

Currently, I am fascinated by functional programming and am learning Haskell/PureScript while being a developer at [Juspay](https://juspay.in) writing PureScript.

When I am not wasting time, I solve [Sudoku](http://websudoku.com/), moderate the [Windows Phone](https://reddit.com/r/windowsphone) subreddit, solve a problem or two on [Codewars](http://codewars.com/users/iammrinal0), and listen to [music](https://last.fm/user/iammrinal0).

Want to collaborate on a project or get in touch with me? The best way is Twitter or mail.
