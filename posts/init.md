Welcome to my blog.

After writing for quite some time in WordPress, I thought why not setup a simple static site with markdown and GitHub for hosting. It took some time to setup but <!-- TEASER_END --> I think it was worth the time, and a good learning experience. I will write a post about the process and tools some time later.

I used to write about tricks in the terminal, Windows support articles, and troubleshooting tips for software I use. Now I also plan to write about various thoughts I have and stuff I see or use. It can be a technical article, a book review, music recommendation, or a rant about anything.

So, let's see how this journey is, now that this is out in the public domain. Also, do send me feedback and comment if something is incorrect. See you on the other side.
